## Project Description

This project implements a **True Random Number Generator (TRNG)** using the **RP2040** microcontroller. The generator collects entropy from an **ADC** (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and mixes it with a **SHA-256** hashing function to produce high-quality random numbers. The randomness is further enhanced by using the **RP2040's RTC (Real-Time Clock)** for time-based entropy.

## Features

- **ADC-based entropy**: Collects noise-based entropy using the RP2040's ADC (GPIO 28).
- **Entropy mixing**: Uses XOR and Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) techniques for mixing the entropy.
- **SHA-256 whitening**: Applies the **SHA-256** hash function to whiten the entropy and reduce correlations.
- **Real-Time Clock (RTC)**: Uses the RP2040's RTC to add time-based entropy for further randomness.
- **Counter-based variability**: Introduces additional variability using an internal counter.

## Requirements

- **RP2040-based microcontroller**.
- **MicroPython** firmware installed on the board.
- **`machine`**, **`utime`**, and **`hashlib`** libraries (built-in with MicroPython).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

- git clone https://github.com/MicroControleurMonde/RP2040-RNG/rp2040-trng.git
- cd rp2040-trng

### 2. Upload the files to your RP2040 board
Upload the following Python files to your RP2040 board:

- rp2040_rng_lib.py
- generate_random.py

### 3. Run the script
Once the files are uploaded, you can run the 'generate_random.py' script to start generating random numbers.

## Usage
#### 1. rp2040_rng_lib.py – Library for generating random numbers
This Python library provides a class ***RandomGenerator*** that generates random numbers based on the RP2040's ADC and a SHA-256 whitening process.

#### 2. generate_random.py – Example script
This script imports the RandomGenerator class from ***rp2040_rng_lib.py*** and generates one random number at a time.

#### Output Example:

Generated random number: 4779610172586853948

## How it Works

### 1. Entropy Collection
The generator uses the ADC to read random noise or fluctuating signals, providing a source of entropy.

### 2. Entropy Mixing
The collected entropy is mixed using XOR operations and a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) to enhance randomness.

### 3. Whitening
The entropy is passed through a SHA-256 hash function to ensure it is unpredictable and unbiased.

### 4. Time-based Entropy
The current Unix timestamp from the RP2040's RTC is used to further whiten the entropy.

### 5. Output
The final output is a 64-bit random number that is periodically generated and can be used in applications requiring randomness.

## Testing Randomness

To ensure the quality of the random numbers, you can use statistical randomness tests such as:

- **Diehard Tests**
[Dieharder: A Random Number Test Suite Version 3.31.1] (https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php)
- **NIST Statistical Test Suite**

These tests will help evaluate the strength of the randomness generated by this code.

## Diehard Test for Validation

To perform a Diehard test reliably and validate the random number generator for RP2040, it is recommended to generate a sample of at least several million bits.

For example, for a sample of 10 million bits, you will need to generate approximately **156,250** 64-bit numbers.

- Diehard test results (over 200,000 values) can be found in the file **'diehard_sample_report.txt '**.
- General results comments  in the file **'diehard_sample_report.md '**.


### Number of bits needed
To generate 1 million bits, you will need to generate about:

$$
\frac{10^{6} \, \text{bits}}{64 \, \text{bits by number}} \approx 15625 \, \text{64-bit numbers}
$$

## Acknowledgements

The project is based on the **RP2040 microcontroller**, and its **MicroPython firmware**.  
The entropy whitening is done using the **SHA-256 algorithm** from the **hashlib** library.

Tested on an original Raspberry Pi Pico, a XIAO seed studio RP2040 and a Waveshare RP2040-Plus. 
The code works perfectly on all three platforms, regardless of the ADC channel used.
